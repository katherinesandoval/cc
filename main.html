		<p class = "intro"> Community colleges are centers of educational opportunity. They are an American invention that put publicly funded higher education at close-to-home facilities, beginning nearly 100 years ago with Joliet Junior College. Since then, community colleges have been inclusive institutions that welcome all who desire to learn, regardless of wealth, heritage, or previous academic experience. The process of making higher education available to the maximum number of people continues to evolve at 1,167 public and independent community colleges. </p> 
		<br>
		<p class = "intro">With their open-access model and low tuition rates, community colleges are a
		gateway to opportunity. Nearly half of all undergraduates attend community
		college. That’s a diverse student population with a diverse array of needs. </p>
		<br>
		<p class = "numb">Community College Mission</p>
		<br>
		<p class = "intro"> The mission of the community college is to provide education for individuals, many of whom are adults, in its service region. Most community college missions have basic commitments to:</p> <br>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Educate and graduate one of the most diverse student populations in the country to become critical thinkers and socially responsible citizens who help to shape a rapidly evolving society. </li>
			<span class = "cc">LaGuardia Community college </span> <br> <br>
			<li>Comprehensive community college providing both liberal arts and career education. It is dedicated to promoting student learning and development as well as strengthening and serving its diverse community.</li>
