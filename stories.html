          After I moved to New York City from Kazakhstan, I wanted to go back to school. I was grateful that LaGuardia was willing to accept me when every other school turned me down. However, LaGuardia did not just accept me - it gave a chance to develop myself intellectually and professionally. In the very first semester, I met professors who encouraged me to create my own path. I wanted a debate club and with their support, I established “Political Arena” where I presided for a year. Same professors brought to my attention a program called “President’s Society”, where our mentors and professors trained us to be the ambassadors for the college. There I have met many wonderful students, who became my good friends and most importantly my support system.<br><br> Overtime, lessons learned at the President’s Society became opportunities and boosted my confidence significantly. Today, I am a very proud to be a LaGuardian. I am about to graduate with a Journalism degree. I am currently interning at Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s office as liaison at the Military Affairs department. In addition, I am a New York Needs You Fellow and a member of a Fellows Leadership Council for it – that is a professional development program where we explore opportunities and various careers.<br><br>  LaGuardia did not just open its doors for me; it also gave me an opportunity to explore other prestigious colleges. For example, this summer I spent five weeks living in a first college in the US that was open for women – Vassar College, where I studied in rigorous and challenging classes while exploring whether I can and like living in the dorm environment. Thankfully, to LaGuardia, I know that I want to study in a liberal arts college and I am confident I will be accepted to one upon my graduation.</p>

          My fascination with technology began in my early childhood. After seeing a futuristic watch with incredible capacities in anime, Sailor Moon, I realized that I wanted to be an engineer. When I came to New York City, I realized that this was the place where I could make my dreams come true. I enrolled at LaGuardia Community College and became a member of the Computer Science club. It was the first step that introduced me to the world of technology. <br><br>During the study, I have grown magnificently in academics. LaGuardia Community College gave me a lot of opportunities to develop my personal, professional and networking skills. Two times I received Foundation Scholarship, was awarded Women in STEM and MAA Maxima Tensor-Summa grants, and became a President’s Society ambassador. The President’s Society gave me a great opportunity to make a contribution to my college and helped me to build the strong foundation of practical skills. With the faculty’s support I became the first female at LaGuardia, who completed the undergraduate research in mathematics, and wrote a paper that was accepted by peer-reviewed journal.<br><br>
          When I took my first class in programming, I had no previous experience. At LaGuardia, I was able to build strong fundamentals and was able to learn other programming languages on my own. I was very excited to apply my new programming skills. Thus, I developed web surveys and report pages for Math, Engineering, and Computer Science Department to minimize the use of paper and simplify the data analysis. Moreover, I participated in the development of the first LaGuardia application with Phi Theta Kappa. 
          My goal is to earn a master’s degree in Computer Science and become a web/software developer. I am determined to be a female entrepreneur and found my own startup to inspire other women and children to pursue their careers in math and science.</p>

          LaGuardia Community College has changed my life significantly. When I arrived to New York, I did not feel myself comfortable. LaGuardia gave me the emotional support I needed as a teenager. It enhanced my confidence to speak English not only in a grammar aspect.
          LaGuardia Community College’s faculty and students’ support made me fall in love with education.
          LaGuardia also taught me of giving back to the community. At LaGuardia Community College, volunteers spent their time with me to strengthen my English level. They improved my conversation and writing skills. After I got accepted into college, I went back to the same program. I began to teach English to international students because I believed that it made a huge difference in my English. 
           In my third semester, I became the part of the real LaGuardia family, President's Society. President’s Society gave me a valuable lesson how to push boundaries beyond my limit.
          One of the most important thing I learned at President’s Society was building confidence about myself and learning about my own capabilities and skills and apply them for personal benefits.
          I always thought that wealthy and successful professionals are born the way they are today. However, I realized along the program that they were born the same way I was born. Hard-work, determination, and great mentors are the 3 big factors that have taken them to their success.
          LaGuardia has been the most amazing event that has happened in my life. I am 22 years old now. I have spent 3 years at LaGuardia, and I cannot compare the experience and the knowledge within these 3 years with rest of my life... To me LaGuardia is home...

        Wai Kat Lam has come a long way since she journeyed from China to the United States when she was 18-years old. “I wanted a change of environment that would bring me opportunity,” says Kat about pursuing a higher education. The Biology Major, Honors student and recognized award-winner finally found what she was  searching for at LaGuardia Community College.
        “My mom wanted me to have a different life than her, so she encouraged me to go to college,” Kat shares about her mother whose elementary-level education limited her options, especially in trying to find a job to support her family.<br><br>
        Heeding her mother’s advice, the ambitious scholar immediately took advantage of the College’s resources and immersed herself in HSAC—the student-run collective that coordinates peer-led transfer and scholarship events and projects that promote student research and civic engagement.  The support from her peers and community motivated Kat to reach even higher: she was elected as HSAC’s executive officer.
        Kat’s dedication to her research on the effects of alcohol on the courtship, mating choices and fertility of fruit flies won her first place at the National Collegiate Honors Council for the 2013 Student Poster Presentation in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. She is also a research intern at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.<br><br>
        Carrying a 3.9 GPA, Kat is also a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, and has won two $1000 LaGuardia Foundation scholarships:  LaGuardia Community College Merit Scholarship for STEM Majors and the Mary and David Soloman Scholarship.
        Kat is looking forward to commencement in June, preparing to celebrate her proud success at LaGuardia with no regrets. After graduation, she will apply for transfer to John Hopkins University, Brown University and Cornell University, towards her dream of becoming a physician to research cancer vaccines.
